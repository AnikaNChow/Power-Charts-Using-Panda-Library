# Power-Charts-Using-Panda-Library


## Description

This project is a Python application that uses the Pandas library to create power charts for visualizing data. The application can read data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and other data sources and create various types of charts to help users understand and analyze the data.

## The charts that can be created with this application include:

1. Line charts
2. Bar charts
3. Scatter plots
4. Area charts
5. Histograms
6. Box plots
7. Heatmaps
8. Pie charts
9. Bubble charts
10. Violin plots

>Users can select the chart type they want to create, choose the data source, and customize the chart settings as needed. The application is designed to be easy to use and flexible, so users can quickly create the charts they need for their specific data analysis needs.

## Installation
To use this application, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official *[setuptools](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is a pre-requisite for installing*

### You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

`$Pandas`
`$Matplotlib`

### You can install these libraries using the pip package manager by running the following commands:

``` 
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib 
```

## Usage

To use the application, run the power_charts.py script using Python from the command line:

``` 
python power_charts.py
```
## Note & About the given Figures
The application will display a menu where you can choose the chart type you want to create, select the data source, and customize the chart settings as needed.However I have used jupyter here to run a dummy data with the panda library. Without connecting any dataset from external. **You can check my code and notice I have plotted the data already in my code. I have also attached my python scripts to the repository. However, for Uemployment Vs Stock Price the code will be same as the DAU Share's one but there's a slight differnce in the second one. The 'align' & 'width' parameters are not a valid argument for the scatter plot function in matplotlib.**
